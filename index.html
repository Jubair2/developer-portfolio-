                    “I began my career in Junior developer , but a few years ago, I was drawn to the healthcare space.
                    I’ve always been skilled at bringing people together and working towards common goals. My experience
                    successfully leading teams and managing stores led me to consider administration, and I’ve been
                    building a career as a driven health administrator for the last four years.”</p>
